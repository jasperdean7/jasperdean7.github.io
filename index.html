  Yet another tattooed IT guy!  I'm found most often in sunny Stoke-on-Trent as some kind of Design and Technology hybrid.  
  What I enjoy most, is collaborating with talented people as part of a multi-disciplinary team.
  "We" build some of the best globally distributed, highly available and innovative systems for the web.  
  We are bet365 - join us? [Current Vacancies](https://www.bet365careers.com/current-vacancies)
