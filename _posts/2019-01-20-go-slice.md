## Go
Below are examples of how to create a slice:
- By specifying the length and the length of the underlying array.
- By using the [low : high] expression.

Additionally, how to `append` and `copy` slices.


```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	//A slice of length 7 with a underlying array of length 14
	x := make([]float64, 7, 14)
	fmt.Println(x)

	//Another way to create a slice is the [low : high] expression.
	arr := [5]float64{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
	slice1 := arr[0:5]
	slice2 := arr[1:4] //High index does not include the index itself
	slice3 := arr[0:]  //Same as arr[0:len(arr)]
	slice4 := arr[:3]  //Same as arr[0:3]
	slice5 := arr[:]   //Same as arr[0:len(arr)]
	fmt.Println(slice1, slice2, slice3, slice4, slice5)

	//append
	slice6 := []int{1, 2, 3}
	slice7 := append(slice6, 4, 5)
	fmt.Println(slice6, slice7)

	//copy
	slice8 := []int{1, 2, 3}
	slice9 := make([]int, 2)
	copy(slice9, slice8)        //Copy has two arguments. 'dst' and 'src'.
	fmt.Println(slice8, slice9) //Only the first two elements are copied into slice9.
}
```
