Lancashire born, Shropshire bred.  

The 80s baby of an English father and Filipino mother. I spent my early years riding around on my old bicycle in the picturesque Ironbridge Gorge; now a World Heritage Site and old heart of the Industrial Revolution.

In the 90’s we made a move to the other end of the “Eastern Primary” on the outskirts of Telford, where primary/secondary school and sixth form went by in no time at all.

After failed attempts at becoming a fighter pilot and then a medical doctor, I decided to embark on a career in Cancer Biology and Immunology at the University of Bristol.  Apart from seeing the original Watson & Crick double helix DNA model, and some amusing lectures on human reproduction, I didn’t fully enjoy my time there.  

So I decided to cut my student loan losses, dropping-out over one Christmas.  The prodigal son had returned!  Short of signing-on at the job centre it wasn’t long before I found part-time work in the local off-license and a place on an IT apprenticeship.  

I suppose from there the rest is history. From service desks, Cat5e cabling, web design and software testing to the online Sports Betting & Gaming industry, I’ve muddled my way through a number of engineering and delivery focused roles.  I enjoy learning, trying to keep up with the latest / emerging tech and collaborating with other passionate and truly skilled people.

I believe we are part of another technological revolution and I’m genuinely excited to see what the future brings!  In my spare time my interests also lie with Rugby Union, Man U, and Sci-Fi.
